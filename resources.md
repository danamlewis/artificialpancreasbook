# Resources

For a narrated video to explain the basics of automated insulin delivery technology, check out [this free video](https://bit.ly/39Paa1O) that uses an analogy of scuba diving to help explain to kids or others with less experience of diabetes. It's also available in [print](https://amzn.to/3tqJHza) or [Kindle](https://amzn.to/39MzCVE) book forms.
